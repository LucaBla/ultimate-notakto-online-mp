# Ultimate Notakto

## Description
Ultimate Notakto is a tic-tac-toe variant that combines <b>Notakto</b> and <b>Ultimate tic-tac-toe</b>. </br>
What makes <b>Notakto</b> special is that <b>both players</b> play the <b>same piece (X)</b>.</br>
The game is <b>divided into 9 sub-boards</b>. </br>
<b>Players</b> always have to <b>play</b> the <b>sub-board corresponding</b> to the field the <b>last piece</b> was placed.</br>
</br>
(<b>Example</b>: if player one places his piece into a bottom left field, the next player must place his piece in the bottom left sub-board)</br>
</br>
A sub-board is <b>lost</b> if a player makes a <b>three-in-a-row</b> there.</br>
If three lost <b>sub-boards</b> are in a row, the player that placed the <b>last piece</b> loses the game.

<div>
  At the <b>beginning of the game</b>, the starting player is <b>free to decide</b> in which sub-board he wants to place his piece.</br>
  The <b>following player</b> must then put his piece in the <b>sub-board corresponding</b> to the field in which the previous player placed his piece.</br>
  If a player has to play a <b>sub-board that has already been lost</b>, he is <b>free to choose</b> which sub-board he wants to play next.</br>
  This <b>principle</b> is maintained for the <b>rest of the game</b>.</br>
</div>

<div>
  </br>(<b>Example</b>: if player one places his piece into a bottom left field, the next player must place his piece in the bottom left sub-board)</br>
